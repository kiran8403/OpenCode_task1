Github is a web-based Git repository, that is. Cloud-based storage is offered by this hosting company. Git’s distributed version control and source code management capabilities are all provided by GitHub, along with some additional features. Utilising Git facilitates collaboration. The public can access GitHub repositories as well. GitHub serves as a networking platform for online professionals since developers from all over the world may engage, contribute to one another’s code, and edit or improve it. Social coding is another name for the process of participation and engagement.
